Upgrade Reminders

Adds icons to soldiers in the squad loadout screen if there are available weapon or PCS upgrades
and that soldier has available slots for these items.

I am a bear of very little brain and usually forget to actually [i]use[/i] the stuff I find on missions.
If you do too, this might be for you.

Position, size, and color of the icons is all configurable with the XComUpgradeReminder.ini file in the Config folder. 
If you are using the workshop, this is found in your steam/steamapps/workshop/content/268500/624726628 folder.
